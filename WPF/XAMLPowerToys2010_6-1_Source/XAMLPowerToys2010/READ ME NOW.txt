Inside the folder named "Copy File In Here" you will find the "XAMLPowerToys2010 - For Testing.AddIn" file.

If you want to develop and test the add-in in a debugger, you MUST copy this file to the "\Visual studio 2010\addins" folder.

This file contains the following line:

    <Assembly>XAMLPowerToys2010.dll</Assembly>

You must edit this line to point to the folder and file name of where your DEBUG build for the XAMLPowerToys.dll is.  

This is typically a long path name.  

on my computer that line reads:   <Assembly>C:\Users\karl\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Projects\XAMLPowerToys2010\XAMLPowerToys2010\bin\XAMLPowerToys2010.dll</Assembly>

Yours will be different.

When you are running the LIVE version from the Little Richie Software direcotry, either remove or rename the "XAMLPowerToys2010 - For Testing.AddIn" file to avoid confusion.
